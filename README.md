# Brent-Oil-Financial-Analysis

Brent Crude is a major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide. Historically price differences between Brent and other index crudes have been based on physical differences in crude oil specifications and short-term variations in supply and demand.

In this repository I am trying to analyse historical trends in the crude oil prices and then try to predict the future trend. Simple satistics and mathematical concepts are used such as Regression, Non-parametric Distributions (Kernel density) etc. More files will be added in the weeks to come.

For now I have worked on the below two:
  1) Statistics and Financial Data Structure
  2) Machine Learning in Market Making
  3) Machine Learning in Passive Investment - Regression Analysis
  4) Machine Learning in Active Investment
